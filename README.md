# Turbokey
Turbokey is a type racing game that integrates with Discord. It allows you to test and improve your typing speed while comparing your performance with your friends in you server.

This is currently a work in progress. Once ready, an invite link for the bot will be made available. 

Some of the planned features are:
- Type Racing: Practice your skills and compete against others to improve your typing speed and accuracy.
- Discord Integration: Link your Discord account to Turbokey and invite the turbo key bot to use custom commands.
- Leaderboards: Track your progress and see how you rank among other users in your server / overall.
- Customizable Experience: Personalize Turbokey with different themes, typing modes, and difficulty levels.

For any queries you can contact me on discord: `k4br`.
